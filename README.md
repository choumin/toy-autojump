# toy-autojump

`toy-autojump` is a toy-like tool to navigate you filesystem based `cd` commands you have executed in the past.

It's incredibly simple to use. Just copy the content of `autojump` file into `~/.bashrc` and `source ~/.bashrc`, then you can use `j dir` to change the working directory to `dir`. It may be fail or change to a directory that is not your expected. However, the longer you use it, the more accurate it will be. Welcome to improve it.
